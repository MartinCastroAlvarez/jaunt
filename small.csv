Ace Hotel New Orleans (The Hotel Bars to Visit Now (and Through the Holidays)),"600 Carondelet St, New Orleans, LA 70130",29.9483781,-90.0721617,"The Ace offers three worthy spots. The lobby bar is what a lobby should be: mostly bar with ample cushy seating arranged into cozy groupings perfect for visiting. Across the way, the ever-so-elegant French-inspired Josephine Estelle bar also serves up tasty bites from the restaurant. Finally, the rooftop bar’s pool beckons drinkers to doff their shoes and dip their toes. Fortunately, we can do this in New Orleans even in December. All offer top notch drinks served by a staff that just stepped out of an H&M ad."

Among the options you’ll find generous fried shrimp, fish, or roast beef and gravy po-boys all coming in at under $10. Another plus: Adams Street’s po-boys are served on perfectly crispy Dong Phuong bread. Take out only. Can get crowded at peak lunch hours."
